The provided code implements an MI decoding exploiting the notions of Cross-Frequency-Coupling (CFC) and Graph Fourier Transform (GFT)
as described in "Connectivity steered Graph Fourier Transform for Motor
Imagery BCI Decoding" by K Georgiadis, N Laskaris, S Nikolopoulos and I
Kompatsiaris published in Journal of Neural Engineering (https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/ab21fd).
The SMR_data_examplar.mat contains EEG data (on a trial-level) from a single subject performing
"left" and "right" imagery data. The complete description of the dataset is available here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340917305930?via%3Dihub
